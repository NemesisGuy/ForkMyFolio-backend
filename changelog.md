## [0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Full CRUD for Qualifications**: Implemented a complete set of endpoints for users to manage their academic and professional qualifications.
*   **OAuth2 Authentication**: Implemented a complete, stateless OAuth2 login flow for providers like Google.
*   **Custom Date Range Validation**: Added a reusable `@ValidDateRange` annotation to ensure an end date is not before a start date.
*   **Enhanced Data Model Relationships**: Linked `Project` and `Experience` entities to `Skill` via a many-to-many relationship.
*   **Standardized API Responses**: Implemented a generic `ApiResponseWrapper<T>` to provide consistent JSON structure for all API responses.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

*   **Architectural Alignment for User Management**: Refactored the admin user management endpoints to strictly adhere to clean architecture principles.
*   **Service Layer Cohesion**: Updated the `UserService` interface to be perfectly in sync with its implementation.
*   **Controllers Refactoring**: Refactored controllers to return raw DTOs, allowing an `ApiResponseWrapperAdvice` to handle wrapping automatically.

### üöÄ Infrastructure & Configuration

*   **Security Configuration**: Updated `SecurityConfig` to integrate and configure the entire OAuth2 login flow.
*   **CORS Configuration**: Centralized CORS configuration within `SecurityConfig`.
*   **JWT Role Prefixing**: Corrected JWT role prefixing to use "ROLE_" in alignment with Spring Security conventions.
