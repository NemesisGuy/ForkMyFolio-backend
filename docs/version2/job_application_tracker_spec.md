## üåê Overview

The Job Application Tracker is a **user-authenticated feature** that allows logged-in users to:

- Add job applications manually (or later via API/browser extension)
- Track statuses like: `Applied`, `Interviewing`, `Offer`, `Rejected`, `Withdrawn`
- Log notes, resume versions used, links, contact persons, and timelines
- Analyze job hunt metrics over time (conversion rates, offer ratios, app volume)

## üë§ User Stories

- "As a user, I want to log job applications so I can track my job hunt."
- "As a user, I want to update the status of my applications."
- "As a user, I want to write private notes per application."
- "As a user, I want to view insights about my applications over time."
- "As a user, I want to export all my job applications to JSON or CSV."

## üîÑ Lifecycle Statuses

```
[DRAFT] ‚Üí [APPLIED] ‚Üí [INTERVIEWING] ‚Üí [OFFER] ‚Üí [ACCEPTED] / [REJECTED] / [WITHDRAWN]

Each status should have a timestamp of when it was set.
