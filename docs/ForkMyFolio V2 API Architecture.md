Summary
The entire API is logically partitioned by access level:

üåç Public Zone (/api/v1/portfolios & /api/v1/settings)
For anonymous visitors to view public portfolios and settings.

üë§ Authenticated User Zone (/api/v1/auth & /api/v1/me)
For logged-in users to manage their portfolio, projects, backups, and settings.

üõ†Ô∏è Admin Zone (/api/v1/admin)
For administrators to manage users, platform stats, settings, and contact messages.

This modular structure makes the API predictable, secure, and maintainable.
