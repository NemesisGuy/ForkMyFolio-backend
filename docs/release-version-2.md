# Release Checklist: Version 2.0.0 - Multi-User Architecture

This document serves as the final checklist for the successful completion of the multi-user architecture refactoring for the ForkMyFolio backend. All planned items have been implemented, tested, and documented.

---

## 1. Core Objective

-   [x] **Goal Achieved**: Evolve the application from a single-instance platform to a multi-user SaaS platform with distinct roles (Guest, User, Admin).

---

## 2. Data Model & Tenancy

-   [x] **User Entity**: The `User` entity has been enhanced with `slug`, `roles`, and `active` status fields.
-   [x] **Data Tenancy**: All portfolio-related entities (`Project`, `Skill`, `Experience`, `Qualification`, `Testimonial`, `PortfolioProfile`, `ContactMessage`) are now correctly associated with a `User` via a foreign key.
-   [x] **Visibility Control**: A `visible` flag has been added to all relevant portfolio entities to allow users to control public visibility.
-   [x] **Unique Slugs**: A `SlugService` has been implemented to generate unique, URL-friendly identifiers for each user upon registration.
-   [x] **Database Schema**: The entire database schema is now managed by Flyway migrations.
    -   [x] `V1__Initial_Schema.sql`: Defines the complete table structure.
    -   [x] `V2__Seed_Initial_Data.sql`: Seeds the database with a default admin user and application settings, replacing the old Java-based initializer.

---

## 3. API Evolution & RESTful Design

-   [x] **API Restructuring**: The API has been logically reorganized into three distinct, role-based categories:
    -   [x] **Public (`/api/v1/portfolios/{slug}`):** For viewing public portfolios and downloading assets (PDF, vCard).
    -   [x] **Authenticated User (`/api/v1/me`):** A full suite of endpoints for users to manage their own account, profile, and all portfolio content (projects, skills, etc.).
    -   [x] **Admin (`/api/v1/admin`):** A consolidated set of endpoints for administrators to manage users, settings, and site-wide content.
-   [x] **Feature Migration**: All single-user features have been successfully migrated to the new architecture.
    -   [x] PDF & vCard generation is now user-specific.
    -   [x] Backup & Restore functionality is now scoped to the authenticated user.
    -   [x] Contact message submission is now directed to a specific user's portfolio.
-   [x] **External IDs**: All public-facing DTOs now use `UUID`s for resource identification, hiding internal database keys.
-   [x] **Standardized Responses**: All API responses are consistently wrapped using the `ApiResponseWrapper` for predictable frontend handling.

---

## 4. Authentication & Security

-   [x] **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Method-level security using `@PreAuthorize` has been implemented across all controllers to enforce strict access rules for `USER` and `ADMIN` roles.
-   [x] **Secure Endpoints**: All `/me/**` and `/admin/**` routes are correctly protected and require a valid JWT.
-   [x] **Enhanced Registration**: The registration process now correctly assigns the default `USER` role and creates the user's profile and slug.
-   [x] **Admin Capabilities**: Administrators can now manage users (update details, change roles, deactivate accounts) through the secure admin API.

---

## 5. Configuration & Deployment

-   [x] **Environment-Specific Configuration**: The project now uses `application.properties` for local development (with local MySQL) and `application-prod.properties` for production, with sensitive values driven by environment variables.
-   [x] **Hibernate & Flyway**: Hibernate's `ddl-auto` is set to `none`, giving Flyway full and safe control over the database schema.
-   [x] **Dockerization**: The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` have been updated to reflect the new production-ready configuration.

---

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

-   [x] **Testing Foundation**: A robust testing framework using JUnit 5 and Mockito has been established.
-   [x] **Initial Unit Tests**: Core business logic in `UserServiceImpl` is now covered by unit tests, setting the standard for future test development.

---

## 7. Documentation

-   [x] **README.md**: The main project `README.md` has been completely rewritten to accurately describe the new multi-user architecture, features, and API structure.
-   [x] **API_ENDPOINTS.md**: This document has been updated with a comprehensive list and examples of all new public, user, and admin endpoints.
-   [x] **Multi-User_Architecture_Plan.md**: The original planning document has been reviewed and updated to serve as an accurate "as-built" architectural reference.

---

**Conclusion:** The refactoring to a multi-user architecture is complete and successful. The project is now scalable, secure, and maintainable, fulfilling all the requirements of the v2.0.0 plan.
